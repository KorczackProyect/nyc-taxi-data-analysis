# NYC Taxi Trips – Transportation & Operations Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores operational and transportation patterns using the **NYC Taxi Trip Duration** dataset.  
The analysis focuses on trip duration, distance, and potential anomalies to extract insights relevant to urban transportation and operations.

This project was developed as part of the **Codecademy – Learn Python for Data Science** skill path and is intended for portfolio purposes.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Load and inspect a real-world transportation dataset
- Clean and prepare data for analysis
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identify patterns and outliers in trip duration and distance
- Extract insights related to transportation efficiency and operations

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle – NYC Taxi Trip Duration  
- **Observations:** ~1.4 million taxi trips  
- **Features include:**
  - Pickup and dropoff datetime
  - Trip duration (seconds)
  - Pickup and dropoff coordinates
  - Passenger count

> Note: Due to size and Kaggle license restrictions, the raw dataset is not included in this repository.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Steps
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning (types, missing values, outliers)
3. Feature preparation (trip duration in minutes)
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Distribution of trip duration
   - Relationship between trip distance and duration
5. Interpretation of operational patterns

---

## 📊 Key Findings
- Trip duration is heavily right-skewed, with most trips lasting under one hour.
- A small number of extreme outliers suggest abnormal or erroneous trips.
- Trip distance and duration show a positive relationship, though variability increases with longer distances.

---

## 🚧 Limitations
- Dataset represents a specific time period and location (NYC, 2016).
- External factors such as traffic, weather, or route choice are not included.
- Some extreme values may still reflect data quality issues.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Incorporate geospatial analysis (maps)
- Segment trips by time of day or passenger count
- Apply basic statistical modeling or clustering
